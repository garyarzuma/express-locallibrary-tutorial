# Local Library

Coding along with the Express tutorial series by MDN to learn how to use the NodeJS Express Framework in creating a basic CRUD app.

Some features like the update and delete functionality was coded by myself as part of a the challenges in the tutorial series.

# Features:

    -Fully functioning libary of books with information on books, authors, genres, and copies of books that can be checked out.
    -Ability to view full lists of all authors, books, book copies, and genres.
    -Ability to create, update, delete, and view all information.

# Demonstrated Skills:

    -Uses the NodeJS Express Framework to handle website routing and html function requests.
    -Uses MongoDB and Mongoose for library database.
    -Uses Pug view templates to dynamically create forms, views, lists and other information.
    -Uses the MVC model of design where the Book models contain references to author and genre models.
    -Modularizes controller functions in separate files to make routing simpler.
